## Fosters' Wife friendly Alarm Clock


</div>

### Description

I am often guilty of saying to my wife that I'll be on the PC for half an hour... only to get a knock on the door 3 hours later!! Not a happy wife!

This alarm clock is the perfect remedy. You set a date/time and it sits unobtrusively on the screen. At the specified dat/time it will raise a message and/or play a WAV and/or execute an app on the alarm time! It's also has some excellent functions in it for file exists, registry save/get setting, wav playing, captionless form drag, stay on top, etc, etc
